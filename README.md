# NeuralDatAnalysis
MATLAB files to analyze neural data obtained from strike response in caterpillars. The neural data was in the form of neural spike rasters that mark events of spike occurrences. 

# Original neural data files
The electromyography(EMG) data files were originally collected as IntanRHD files from [Intan amplifiers](http://intantech.com/products_RHD2000.html) that were converted to text files for further analysis.

# Analysis
The text files were converted to rasters that mark events of spikes and processed further temporally. They were combined using an averaging method to account for variability in different neural rasters.
