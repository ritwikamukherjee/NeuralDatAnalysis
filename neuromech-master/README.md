neuromech
=========

These are collected general purpose Matlab functions.  They are roughly organized into several general areas:
* variable handling functions.  Primarily for moving variables around between files, the base workspace, and calling functions.
* many functions for graphics.  Improvements to several existing plot styles, and many functions for easier manipulation of plots.
* functions for angular statistics.  A toolbox for angular statistics.

== Installation ==

After you've cloned the repository, you'll need to set the Matlab paths appropriately.  I've included a script to do that.  In Matlab, do the following

<code>
  cd /path/to/neuromech;
  install_here
</code>
