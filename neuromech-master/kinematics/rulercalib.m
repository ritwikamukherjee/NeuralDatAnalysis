% function [scale,err,N,distpix,distmm] = rulercalib(im,space)
% Calibrates an image based on points clicked on a ruler.  Allows the user
% to zoom to the ruler and then click as many points as he/she wants.  Uses
% the distances between the points to get the scale.
% Takes the image im and the distance (in mm) between the points clicked on
% the ruler.
% Returns the scale (in mm/pix), the error on the scale, the number of points
% used to calculate the scale, and the actual distances between points on the
% ruler and the expected distances in mm.
% NB: assumes that pixels are square.  The ruler can be at any angle in the frame,
% but it doesn't allow any pixel aspect ratio.
