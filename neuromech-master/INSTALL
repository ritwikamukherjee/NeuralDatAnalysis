Clone or download the repository from github (https://github.com/tytell/neuromech) and put it in some useful location.

From Matlab run the install_here script:

>> cd /path/to/neuromech
>> install_here

You should get a prompt asking to add the relevant paths to your Matlab path.  Click OK and you should be good to go!
