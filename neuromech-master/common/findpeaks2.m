function varargout = findpeaks2(y, varargin)
%FINDPEAKS2   Finds peaks in y.
% function [peak,peakind,...] = findpeaks2(y, ...)
% Options:
%     'max','min',or 'minmax' - Finds maxima, minima or both (default = max)
%     'numneighbors' - Makes sure each peak is greater (less) than
%         numneighbors on both sides (default = 1)
%     'maxflat' - Maximum number of points at the top of a peak that can be
%         exactly equal to each other (default = 1)
%     'strict' - Strict peak finding, meaning that that the top of the peak
%         must be greater (less) than each neighbor, but also that each
%         neighbor must be greater (less) than the successive neighbor on
%         the peak's slope
%     'sort' - Sorts the peaks.  Options are 'up','down','absup','absdown'
%         or 'none'
%     'threshold' - Threshold for the peaks.  NB: for minmax, this is an absolute
%         threshold, but for the others, its sign is not changed
%     'minpeakdistance' - Minimum distance between peaks
%     'morepeaks','biggerpeaks' - Defines the bias for how to sort peaks that are too
%        close.  'morepeaks' will potentially throw out a large peak, if it allows the
%        minpeakdistance criterion to hold, while 'biggerpeaks' always takes the largest
%        peaks.  Default is 'morepeaks'
%
% Returns:
%     peak - The values of the peaks, in the same order as y.
%     peakind - The indices of the peaks.  For flat peaks, returns the
%        index of the central point (rounded down)
%     peaksign - Only returned for 'minmax' finding.  Returns 1 for maxima
%        and -1 for minima.
